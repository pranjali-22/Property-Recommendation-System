# Property-Recommendation-System

What is an appraisal?
An appraisal is a report on the estimated fair market value of a home.

How is an appraisal done?
Looking at similar properties and seeing how much they are sold for

Why do we need ML here?
When an appraiser is appraising a property they have hundereds of properties to consider
They need to find the best 3 comps for the appraisal

Given a dataset of appraisals where each appraisal contains information on the -
1. Subject property
2. List of all properties available
3. 3 comps that were selected
Build a recommendation system with an ML model for selecting the best comps given a new dataset

Good Comps
1. Sold recently
2. Same property type and structure type as subject
3. Similar features
4. Similar neighborhood/location
5. Similar quantity/condition and age
